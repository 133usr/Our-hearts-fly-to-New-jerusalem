## THANKS TO GOD ELOHIM
This project was bootstrapped with [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack).
First of all this project is based on CPSIUN JS

So I went to theflightaware.com go the flight name from there like from delhi to korea
then I searched that flight on https://globe.adsbexchange.com/  or better option is https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/CPA640/history/20231210/1740Z/VNKT/VHHH

Surat to AHMEDABAD 
AHMEDABAT TO DELHI
DELHI TO KOREA
KATHMANDU TO HONGKONG
HONGKONG TO QUANZHOU
QUANZHOU TO JANGZHOU
HANGZHOU TO JEJU
JEJU TO GWUANJU
GWUANJU TO SEOUL

then I got the geometric altitude egm96 on the left side down button 
convert the kml to csv https://anyconv.com/kml-to-csv-converter/
 and you got the points

## THINGS TO DO
##### Rules
# LOGIC IS 7770km to Heavenly Mother
# from surat korea I have 2700 markers
# so if 20km a day then you can reach in a year, and some might even do more than that.. so 20km or 15km should be max including everything


So the coordinates are the scores, 
** Calculate the coordinates(where the model should be) in google sheets and then pass them as data to this project.
** you can 

As for the height you can give a rnadom number but group them by ages 
Adult Sisters Ruth random number from 10000-11000
Adult Sisters Sarah random number from 9000-10000
Adult Sisters Esther random number from 8000-9000
Youth Sisters random number from 8000-9000

Adult Brothers  random number from 11000-12000
Youth brothers random number from 11000-12000


## HOW TO HANDLE SCORES 
Okay so when I wanted to move the model I have this file named scored data.JSON and it has all the longitudes and latitude of the map along with the properties that is the numbers and the numbers will be scores so when I'm going to do is 
I am going to access those numbers for example like if someone has score of 500 km then he will be getting the number something like 6 or 7 according to his score and when the number is retrieved from the Google sheet then I am going to take that and in a function I will call a temporary Array for the flight data the number will be subtracted by 5 so I can get the flight data of it 
if the number is 7 then I get from 2 to 7 and the plane will fly from the longitude and latitude of the number 2 to the longitude and latitude of the number 7 






## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`
### `npm run deploy` to deploy to github pages



#### To-do
- [ ] CENTER CAMERA ON MODEL WHEN NAME IS CLICKED 
- [ ] increase dat.gui size and soft close
- [ ] CHANGE renderer.setClearColor(0x131A3D, 1); COLOR BY DAY TIME
