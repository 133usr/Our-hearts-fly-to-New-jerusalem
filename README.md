## THANKS TO GOD ELOHIM
This project was bootstrapped with [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack).
First of all this project is based on CPSIUN JS

So I went to theflightaware.com go the flight name from there like from delhi to korea
then I searched that flight on https://globe.adsbexchange.com/  or better option is https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/CPA640/history/20231210/1740Z/VNKT/VHHH

Surat to AHMEDABAD 
AHMEDABAT TO DELHI
DELHI TO KOREA
KATHMANDU TO HONGKONG
HONGKONG TO QUANZHOU
QUANZHOU TO JANGZHOU
HANGZHOU TO JEJU
JEJU TO GWUANJU
